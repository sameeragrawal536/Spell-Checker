# Spell-Checker
A spell checker created in C. Given a txt file, it will compare each word of the file against a separate dictionary, and print all the words it cannot find in the dictionary, indicating that these words are "misspelled".

The program incorporates a hash function and a linked list, both made from scratch, in order to organize the words in the dictionary, making the program more efficient. 

When running the program, run "speller.c", inputing the name of the txt file you would like for it to check. An example run would be: "./ speller constitution.txt", if "constitution.txt" were the text you are trying to spell check.
